Dear Diary,

Time : 10:39am

Today i woke up at 9:30am did brush and washed my face that's it. Now i should start studying second week. Yesterday i completed first chapter. Now its time for second.
i did second chapter it is so boring i did it in a hurry, so i need to revisit that chapter later. I was distracted today. i couldn't able to study. yesterday me and dad went out to purchase air conditioner. But we couldn't able to choose one, the ac we want is not available, in one shop it is available but they are charging too much amount of money. so we quit that shop also, today i tried to reset the tablet again but it is also a failure. And finally i fell asleep at 1am seeing inception movie.

Today is not a productive day because i was so much distracted, i need to focus on my studies, for that exam.

- **Good night**
