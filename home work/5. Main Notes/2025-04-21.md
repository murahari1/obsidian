Dear Diary,
Time : 12:00 afternoon
Today i tried to do somethings like creating my cloud storage, i am losing the mood to do it, but i cant abandon in half way i will do it somehow, and today i want to complete an anime, installed obsidian in my home pc now i can do shit with it.

I removed my mouse pad, gonna buy a new mouse pad. From tomorrow i should study. i will try again to convert my seagate hard drive into a cloud storage where i can do crud operation from anywhere from this world, after that i should replace my alexa with grook or chatgpt.

And i think it cant be done today lets see.... and i should start doing that project which is given by cc sir. my only concern is about the second project. like how can we make computer understand about sign language maybe there is some apis for that and even so, the api uses the shape of hand and how could we tell which sign is which? dont know i will figure it out and lets try to complete that cloud storage and replace alexa with chatgpt or grook.

i will be right back
