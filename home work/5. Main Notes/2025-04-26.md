Dear Diary,
Time : 11:50am

Today i woke up at 9:00am and did normal stuff. i got a phone call from delivery guy. Ac is delivering now and stabilizer will be delivered tomorrow. Ac will be delivered today. Now i have to start studying and after studying i need to read that book. what is difference between study and read? May be study means read and understanding something and reading means just reading that means i should study that book not read. Better start studying week 5 pdf.
