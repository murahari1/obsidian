Dear Diary,
Time : 11:50am

Today i woke up at 9:00am and did normal stuff. i got a phone call from delivery guy. Ac is delivering now and stabilizer will be delivered tomorrow. Ac will be delivered today. Now i have to start studying and after studying i need to read that book. what is difference between study and read? May be study means read and understanding something and reading means just reading that means i should study that book not read. Better start studying week 5 pdf.
Completed week 5 and watched one movie called in time and downloaded one game uncharted. Its a treasure hunt game.

Tried to slept at 1am but i remembered apna college and i tried to login it but the password is changed by her. I tried so many times but its not logging in. why did she changed the password? why? I also paid for that. I messaged her that "did you changed the password for apna college.", and i slept at 2am.
