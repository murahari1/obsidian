Dear Diary,

Time: 8:44am
Today i woke up at 7:30am, went out to bring tomatoes, wrote dairy.
I am starting to study.

Time: 4:25pm 
Completed week 1 pdf, I studied and wrote notes which i will refer afterwards. i took break between studying to eat, i made dosa and ate by myself. its tasty. After eating dosa i remembered that i forget to brush my teeth. so brushed my teeth. now i am thinking to read book or watch a movie. Based on my mood. or should i study on something interesting like web-dev or hacking. i don't know lets see... what my mood tells. that's it for now.
