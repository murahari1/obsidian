Dear Diary,
Time : 11:10am

Today i woke up at 9am. And i brushed my teeth, washed my face. after that i ate dosa. Talked with my dad about ac. we booked daikin 1.8 ton ac its cost is 63k and one vguard stabilizer worth of 5k and one smart plug which i can control with alexa and my phone. Right now i should start studying or else i couldn't able to complete my daily milestone.

I completed week 3, I should also study assignment questions. i cooked lady's finger yesterday. After completing week 3, I studied 48 laws of power book. In that i studied about law 10, this law is about infection unhappy and unlucky, we should stay away from people who are unlucky and unhappy, I studied about one girl's story lora montez. she is never happy, and she ruined life of a king, and other two prestigious man. finally she turned into a priest telling about god at the age of 41. so i should stay away from people who are unhappy and unlucky their misery can drown me. Just like her, she is never happy, even the slightest problem she will look like it is very big and it will kill her. I should stay away from those kind of people.

After that i went out with my sister to bring one pot for home. That's it i ate food and i slept around 12:30 while watching inception.
