Dear Diary,
Time: 11:35am

Today i woke up at 8:30 am and seen her message, she answered no to my question and she told me i am in home don't text or reply to me. How arrogant of her?, here i am trying to studying and i am asking for what's mine and she said don't text me. I replied to her that "Check the password, i already tried so many times, just tell me the password i wont disturb you, sorry for replying." i shouldn't have said sorry, i am just asking for what's mine right? i replied her before 3hours and she didn't replied me yet. Fuck her!!!!!, i am so irritated by her, how much time it will take to change the password? hardly five minutes. I should reply her with no drama no sorry, remember murahari what you did is right. no matter what i do, i am always right, i should imprint that shit in my mind!.
