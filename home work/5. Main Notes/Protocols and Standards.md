## *What are protocols and standards ?*

Protocols are like rules that devices follows to communicate.

Standards are like guidelines to use protocols so that data transmission goes smoothly.


## *Protocols*

some common protocols - networks language
### *Internet protocol (IP)*

It assigns address to a networking device and route it.
there are two types of internet protocols.
1. IPv4 - it is a 32 bit address which are limited to 4.3 billion addresses.
2. IPv6 - since IPv4 is limited to 4.3 billion devices they created another address which is 128 bit long making it can assign up to trillions of devices.
basically this addresses are used to locate in the forest of internet. And it will direct packets from your route.

### *Transfer control protocol (TCP)*

TCP ensures reliable delivery. it breaks data into packets and checks that each packet is received by the receiver.
it uses [Three way handshake](https://www.guru99.com/tcp-3-way-handshake.html) to transfer data (SYN,SYN-ACK,ACK).

### *User datagram protocol(UDP)*

UDP protocol is less reliable, no handshake, no guarantee, its for speed over accuracy.
Its is used online games, streams and whatsapp video calls.

### *Address resolution protocol (ARP)*

It will link IP to MAC address (mac address belongs to a device which is assigned by the device manufacturer)

### *hyper text transfer protocol (http)*

It fetches webpages and https adds security to a webpage.


## *Standards*

These are official agreements that shapes protocols. Basically these are rules upon protocols. They let you communicate with a different kind of device. standards ensure compatibility across devices and networks.

These are set by groups like IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering), IETF(Internet Engineering Task force) or ISO(International Organization for standardization)
IETF handles the implementation parts.

Ethernet uses IEEE 802.3 standards.
WIFI uses IEEE 802.11 standards.
There are lot of standards which are set by IEEE
