*Network Architecture* is a visualizing how networking components talks to each other.

## *Protocol Stack*

1. *Physical layer* : convert digital data into analog signal or vice versa.
2. *Data link layer* : it will ensure all the devices accessing the data properly.
3. *Network layer* : It will finds the easy path to transfer data.
4. *Transport layer* : It will control the traffic of the network.
5. *Application layer* : It will provide a user interface for the user to interact with network.

### *protocols at different layers*

*Physical layer* : Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), WIFI (IEEE 802.11) works here but not too much.
*Data link layer* : Ethernet, WIFI, Bluetooth, UMTS(Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (3G Network bro)), LTE(Long term evolution).
*Transport layer* : Transfer control protocol(TCP) reliable protocol it ensures the data is transferred completely
