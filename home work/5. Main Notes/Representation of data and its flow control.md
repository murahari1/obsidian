### *what is a computer network ?*

A Computer Network is a group of devices which talks to each other to send and receive data.
These devices are Networking devices like router, switch, hub, pc, laptop etc....
It will communicate to each other to move data fast.

## *Representation of Data*

Representation of data is how we convert real world data like -Numbers, float values, pictures, videos and audios into a format which computer can understand.

Initially computer can able to understand binary which are 0's and 1's so we will break every given data into binary format so that computer can understand and process it. 
pics are broke down into pixels with RGB values and into binary.
numbers and float values are converted directly into binary.
After doing this computer can able to understand the data which we provide and process it.

## *How data flows ?*

Data flows in bits from one device to another device, each bit has either 0 or 1, the data travels between devices in the form of packets.
Packets are small chunks with headers. it follows OSI model like physical layer send data in bits, then Data link layer make packets from that bits, Network layer route these packets.


## *Flow control*

It will ensure that data doesn't overwhelm the receiver, keeping everything and running smoothly.
Using some methods
- stop and wait
- sliding window
