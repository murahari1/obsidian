## *Network Topology*

A network topology is a structure or organization of devices connect in a network.
There are 8 types of topologies:- 
- Bus topology
- Star topology
- Ring topology
- Mesh topology
- Tree topology 
- Hybrid topology
- Point to Point topology
- Daisy chain


### *Bus topology*

A single cable is connected to every device and make a network. Data travels through this cable. The ends need terminator to stop from bouncing back. If terminators are not there in ends devices get the same data again and again so we need terminators.

Its Advantages are cheap and good for small networks.
Disadvantages are if one devices get malfunctioned or disconnected whole network will be off.
