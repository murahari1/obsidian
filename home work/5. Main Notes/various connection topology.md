## *Network Topology*

A network topology is a structure or organization of devices connect in a network.
There are 8 types of topologies:- 
- Bus topology
- Star topology
- Ring topology
- Mesh topology
- Tree topology 
- Hybrid topology
- Point to Point topology
- Daisy chain


### *Bus topology*

A single cable is connected to every device and make a network. Data travels through this cable. The ends need terminator to stop from bouncing back. If terminators are not there in ends devices get the same data again and again so we need terminators.

Its Advantages are cheap and good for small networks.
Disadvantages are if one devices get malfunctioned or disconnected whole network will be off.


### *Star topology*

In this star topology all devices are connected to only one hub through its own cable. Data goes to hub to reach its destination.
Its advantages are if any cable disconnects the individual device gets effected not the whole system like bus topology.
its disadvantages are if hub dies then the whole network stops. It needs more cables than bus topology.


### *Ring topology*

In ring topology every device connects to its next device forming a ring. Data travel in one direction or in both directions (in dual-ring setups).
Its advantage is Equal access for all devices.
Its disadvantages are if one device dies whole network gets affected, and it is very tricky to add a device to this network.


### *Mesh topology*

In mesh topology every device is connected to every other device making it reliable. For n devices n(n-1)/2 connections will be there.
Its advantages are it is super reliable meaning no single failure can stop the flow of network.
Its disadvantages are it is messy a lot, it needs more cables to connect and adding a network is super hard.


### *Tree topology*
